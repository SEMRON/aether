This directory should be used to store deploy keys, and other secrets that shall not be automatically synced.
(neither to deployments, nor to git)

Example to generate a keypair for cloning the repo:
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "aether clone key" -f clone-key

and the corresponding clone-key.pub can then be added as a read only deploy key on github
https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/settings/keys
